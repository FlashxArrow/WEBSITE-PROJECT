After his personal tragedy of his late Uncle Ben, Peter began using his spider-powers to fight against crime as Spider-Man.Spider-Man had no superhero mentor like Captain America and Batman; he thus had to learn for himself that <font color="orange"><q>with great power comes great responsibility</q></font>.
